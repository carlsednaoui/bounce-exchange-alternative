A small library enabling you to display a modal before a user leaves your website.

> **Quick note**: [Let me know](https://twitter.com/carlsednaoui) if you end up using OuiBounce. I'd love to hear about your project / see OuiBounce in the wild :)

### The philosophy behind this project

This library helps you increase landing page conversion rates. From my experience, you can expect a lift of 7% to 15% depending on your audience, traffic type (paid or unpaid) and copy.

Talking about copy... __please__ use OuiBounce to __provide value__ to your visitors. With tools like these __it's very easy to create something spammy-looking__.

Not sure what I mean by _provide value_? Here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing:

## Demo / Example

## Installation

Download the [minified](build/ouibounce.min.js) or [unminified](build/ouibounce.js) script and include it on your page. OuiBounce is wrapped by a [umd wrapper](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/umd), so if you are using _requirejs/amd_ or _commonjs/browserify_, it will still work fine.

You can also get OuiBounce from [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/ouibounce/).

### Usage

1. Create a hidden modal
1. Select the modal with vanilla JavaScript (or jQuery) and call `ouiBounce`
1. Optional: Save the function's return value to use the public API, allowing you to `fire` or `disable` OuiBounce on demand

_Example:_    
```js
ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'));
```

_Example with jQuery:_    
```js 
ouiBounce($('#ouibounce-modal')[0]);
```

_Example using the public api:_    
```js
var modal = ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'));
modal.fire()
```

##### Options

OuiBounce offers a few options, such as:

- Sensitivity
- Aggressive mode
- Timer
- Callback
- Cookie expiration

__Sensitivity:__ Define how far the mouse has to be from the window breakpoint. The higher value, the more sensitive, and the more quickly the event will fire. _Defaults to 20._

_Example:_    
```js
ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { sensitivity: 40 });
```

__Aggressive mode:__ By default, OuiBounce will only fire once for each visitor. When OuiBounce fires, a cookie is created to ensure a _non obtrusive_ experience.

There are cases, however, when you may want to be more aggressive (as in, you want the modal to be elegible to fire anytime the page is loaded/ reloaded). An example use-case might be on your paid landing pages. If you enable `aggressive`, the modal will fire any time the page is reloaded, for the same user.

_Example:_    
```js
ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { aggressive: true });
```

__Set a min time before OuiBounce fires:__ By default, OuiBounce won't fire in the first second to prevent false positives, as it's unlikely the user will be able to exit the page within less than a second. If you want to change the amount of time that firing is surpressed for, you can pass in a number of milliseconds to `timer`.

_Example:_    
```js
ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { timer: 0 });
```

__Callback:__ You can add a callback, which is a function that will run once OuiBounce has been triggered, by using the `callback` option.

_Example:_    
```js
ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { callback: function() { console.log('OuiBounce fired!'); } });
```

__Cookie expiration:__ Ouibounce sets a cookie by default to prevent the modal from appearing more than once per user. You can add a cookie expiration (in days) using `cookieExpire` to adjust the time period before the modal will appear again for a user. By default, the cookie will expire at the end of the session, which for most browsers is when the browser is closed entirely.

_Example:_    
```js
ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { cookieExpire: 10 });
```

__Multiple options:__ The options are just a javascript object, so if you want, you can also combine multiple options.

_Example:_    
```js
ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), {
  aggressive: true,
  timer: 0,
  callback: function() { console.log('ouiBounce fired!'); }
});
```

##### OuiBounce API

If you save the object that the `ouiBounce` function returns, it exposes a small public API you can use to control your modal. Using this API, you can use `fire` to show the modal whenever you want or `disable` to disable ouibounce entirely.

_Example:_    
```js
var modal = ouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'));
modal.fire(); // fires the ouibounce event
modal.disable() // disable ouibounce, it will not fire on page exit
modal.disable({ cookieExpire: 50, sitewide: true }) // disable ouibounce sitewide for 50 days. 
```
